### Get some funds

The testnet faucet is enabled in development mode so that some addresses can be funded.

1. Funding

	Browse to the http://localhost:4000/faucet and enter any address to send funds to. 

	It should transfer 100 UCO to the given address.

2. Check the balance

	Go to http://localhost:4000/explorer/transaction/{TYPE_YOUR_ADDRESS_IN_HEXADECIMAL}

	It should display 100 unspent outputs (in the "Ledger inputs" section)

## Public

Public testnet is available at [https://testnet.archethic.net](https://testnet.archethic.net)

### Get some funds

You can then go the [faucet](https://testnet.archethic.net/faucet) to get free UCOs to experiment the Arch ethic network
