title: OracleChain Memory Tables
---

OracleChain component provides [scheduler](/build/core/oracle-chain/scheduler) and [services](/build/core/oracle-chain/service) to maintain transaction chain and real world data integration.

We need a way to access quickly this information for better computation latency.

For this purpose, the OracleChain service maintains a memory table using ETS to hold the information according to their date.

It represented in that way:

| Timestamp | Service | Data |
|-|-|-|

For example for the UCO service we may have:

|Timestamp|Service|Data|
|-|-|-|
| 1622801400 | UCO | %{ "eur" => 0.02 } |


The table loads after each oracle or oracle summary transaction and during the bootstrap for faster computation.

The transaction's fee algorithm is using this cached information to provide this computation quickly
