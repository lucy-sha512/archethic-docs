OracleChain is an internal mechanism inside Arch Ethic Node Software that fetches external data to embedd in a transaction.

It's built around three main components:
- List of [services](/build/core/oracle-chain/service) or provider
- [Scheduler](/build/core/oracle-chain/scheduler)
- [InMemory database](/build/core/oracle-chain/memory-table)
