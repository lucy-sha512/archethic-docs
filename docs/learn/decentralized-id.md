## Identity

On the internet, a user can have multiple identities. For example, a user’s login credentials for Amazon.com or a banking system are stored on the respective centralised servers. Users’ hardware wallets contain private keys to access decentralised financial applications.

Whether it’s Amazon’s login credentials or the private keys in a hardware wallet, both have a single point of failure. For the former, the user is always uninformed of how his or her credentials are being used. Users’ trust in third-party organizations regrading their identities has been weakened as a result of a series of data dumps that have lately emerged.

For the latter, holding private keys in a single location may potentially expose them to phishing attempts aimed at gaining access to their private keys and, as a result, compromising their crypto identity.

Archethic’s Decentralized Identity provides individual privacy and resiliency by enabling users to get passwordless access to their identities stored at multiple nodes in the blockchain. Consequently, rather of handing over control of one’s identity to a third party, it retains it in the control of the individual.

Archethic was designed mainly to resolve one big issue that we are facing right now in technology: to provide a secure and easy way to identify ourselves.

Decentralized identity avoids the need of entrusting one's identity to a third party, who might find itself in a conflict of interest and exploit our identity without our knowledge.
This person retains sole control of his/her identity, which is stored on a multitude of nodes ensuring its durability and integrity.

Hence Archethic's decentralized identity is brought by the Archethic transaction chain which enables authorization, end-to-end encryption, and upgradability in the decentralized network.

The identity is or will be compatible and interoperable with other standards in the industry such as W3C DID, FIDO2, WebAuthn, etc.

## Password-less

While digital identity is being standardized, we also designed a new way to connect and access this identity: password-less authentication.

Embedded in the blockchain, on-chain wallet access allows anyone to identify themselves using several methods: biometric, hardware (USB, ledger), or event password. (We don't want to prevent passphrase from being used, just keep it as the lowest secure authentication method).

For this reason, we have created a [Keychain](/learn/decentralized-id/keychain), a new way to access our private keys for several services easily.

The idea of an on-chain wallet, end to end encrypted wallet, makes the password-less possible in the near future.
